# Wordcount

This program mimicks the WordCount, i.e. it reads text files and counts how often words occur. The input is text files, and the output is text files, each line of which contains a word and the count of how often it occurred, separated by a tab.
The code is split into 2 files of mapper.py and reducer.py.
